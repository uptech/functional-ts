# functional-ts

This is a TypeScript library that provides key utilities to make writing
TypeScript code in a functional style easier.

*Note:* This is a specific boutique library catered to the functional features
we use here at [UpTech][] and it isn't intended in anyway to be a giant
complete library for all things funtional.

There are a number of those that exist and are opinionated in their own ways.
We have opted to just maintain our own super tiny library focused on the areas
we use all the time.
